# HeatTransfer
Use Heat Transfer as the main file which includes the formula to quantify the heat transfer through a porous structure. 
Use the optimizer to optimize the cell parameters to a minimized heat transfer through the structure. 
Sensitivity Analysis (SA): conduction, convection, radiation
