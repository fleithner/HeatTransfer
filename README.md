# HeatTransfer
Use Heat Transfer as the main file which includes the formula to quantify the heat transfer through a porous structure and the resulting U value.
Use the optimizer to optimize the individual cell parameters to a minimized heat transfer through the structure. 
Sobol SA is used to quantify the impact of specific parameters on the heat transfer.
